# GPS_Circular_DMA_Buffer

This is a test example for the circular DMA UART implementation for reading GPS NMEA data. 
It is based in akospasztor's example code and great job (https://github.com/akospasztor/stm32-dma-uart/blob/master/README.md#references) and is, by far, the best method I found to read variable/unknown length messages throug the UART
